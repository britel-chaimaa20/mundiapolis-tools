Emacs helps you be productive by providing an integrated environment for many different kinds of tasks:

  - All of the basic editing commands (and there are lots of them) are available no matter what you're trying to do: write code, read a manual, use a shell, or compose an email.
  - All the tools Emacs provides for opening, saving, searching, and processing text (and more) are available to you no matter what you're doing.

In this project, we will practice on the different commands that Emacs provide to its users.
